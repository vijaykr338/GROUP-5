Hospitals face challenges in managing multiple complex processes,
including patient management, resource allocation, appointment scheduling, medical billing, and inventory control.
Current manual or semi-digital systems often lead to inefficiencies, delays in care, and data mismanagement,
which directly affect the quality of healthcare delivery.
A comprehensive digital solution is needed to streamline hospital operations,
ensuring a seamless experience for both patients and healthcare providers.
